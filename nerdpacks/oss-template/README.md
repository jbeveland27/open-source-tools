# nr1-template-nerdpack

![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-template-nerdpack?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-template-nerdpack/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-template-nerdpack)

## Usage

nr1-template-nerdpack uses the `PageView` events in New Relic to interrogate and categorize the performance of a web site. You can explore the performance of individual pages, and forecast how improving performance impacts KPIs like bounce rate and traffic. This analysis is based on moving individual browsing sessions from `Tolerated` and `Frustrated` into `Satisfied` (as defined by the [`apdex`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) value for a given New Relic Browser application).

## What problem(s) does this application solve?

- Bullet point sentence giving the user a heads up about what to expect.
- Second bullet focused on a paragraph that might be a good first draft for [developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com) to start from we chose to feature the application there.
